## Hi there! 👋 I'm Samantha Vanini, a Passionate Software Engineer @ Fairmat SRL

🧑‍💻 I am a Software Engineer experienced in Front-end development, with the right thirst for knowledge to know better the dark side of the web, aka Back-end

🧑‍🎓 I'm also an university student in my free time, actually pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science @ UniVR. I like the world of data, in particular all the processes leading to the extraction, from raw sources, of meaningful information

🛠️ My tech toolkit includes JavaScript, TypeScript, VueJS, Vuex/Pinia and Cypress. I like working in Agile environments, emphasizing unwavering quality.

🌱 I am currently learning a bit of C#, to better understand the whole software development lifecycle. Furthermore, I am leaning towards Python for the data management and engineering tasks

### Open source contributions

During my years as Front-end developer, I contributed to the following projects, with the goal to improve my skills and test my knowledge of a uniquely challenging topic - UI accessibility - and practise a bit more in TypeScript

- [Quasar Framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar)
- [PrimeVue](https://github.com/primefaces/primevue)
